# 🚀 Deployment Instructions

I cannot run `git` or `vercel` commands directly from this environment, but your code is **100% ready for deployment**.

Please run one of the following options in your terminal to update your live site.

## Option 1: Push to GitHub (Recommended)
This will trigger an automatic deployment on Vercel if your project is connected.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Luxury redesign of Dashboards and Detail Page"
git push
```

## Option 2: Deploy with Vercel CLI
If you want to deploy directly from your machine:

```bash
vercel --prod
```
